When using the 'FastAPITransactionCase' class, allows to specify a specific
override of the 'authenticated_partner_impl' method into the list of
overrides to apply. Before this change, the 'authenticated_partner_impl'
override given in the 'overrides' parameter was always overridden in the
'_create_test_client' method of the 'FastAPITransactionCase' class. It's now
only overridden if the 'authenticated_partner_impl' method is not already
present in the list of overrides to apply and no specific partner is given.
If a specific partner is given at same time of an override for the
'authenticated_partner_impl' method, an error is raised.
