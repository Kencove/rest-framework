Odoo has done an update and now, it checks domains of ir.rule on creation and modification.

The ir.rule 'Fastapi: Running user rule' uses a field (authenticate_partner_id) that comes from the context.
This field wasn't always set and this caused an error when Odoo checked the domain.
So now it is set to *False* by default.
